This repository contains three Java programs:

1. OddEven.java: A program that separates even and odd numbers from a given input array and prints them.

2. NearestNeighbours.java: This program implements a function to find the index of the first number among two neighboring numbers with the smallest distance in an array.

3. ArrayConversion.java: A Java program to convert an array into an ArrayList and vice versa.

## Note: All programs were wrote in notepad and ran using command prompt .
